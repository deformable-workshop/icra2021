							<h2>Workshop proposal ICRA2021: Representing and Manipulating Deformable Objects</h2>
							
							<p>
							Deformable objects manipulation is a key component of a variety of everyday and specialized applications, ranging
from domestic housework such as cloth folding or food handing, to medical scenarios such as surgery and suturing,
up to industrial setups such as cable insertion. However, the large configuration space of deformable objects
causes traditional modelling, planning and control approaches to fail when dealing with them. More specifically,
unlike in the case of rigid objects, two main challenges arise: i) there is no clear and unified state representation
and ii) their dynamics is complex and highly non-linear. This leads to the absence of current unified solutions and
to highly domain-specific approaches in the fields of perception, simulation, control and mechanics. In addition,
the lack of scalable simulation environments limits possible developments in the above fields. We believe that
robust progress can only be achieved by combining these complementary areas of robotics. Therefore, this
workshop aims to start a discussion about the current state of the art and possible research directions as well as
connect people from different sub-fields to solve deformable objects challenges.

							<h3>Event description </h3>

							<p> 
								The workshop is tailored towards researchers interested at deformable object manipulation and closely related
problems such as modeling, perception, and representation. This workshop would give the community a chance
to: identify open research challenges, find new applications for techniques that already exist in closely related
areas, foster new collaborations, and get a good overview of the state of the art from the invited talks. Speakers
from the forefront of the research on deformable objects are invited to provide top-level insights. Furthermore,
a review process from experienced researcher will be carried out giving young researchers the opportunity to
receive valuable feedbacks.
The scope of the workshop is intentionally broad, as many of the challenges, especially the question of
representation and simulation are important for the majority of relevant research problems. We think the
workshop would be of interest to researchers from the target field as currently the work on deformable objects
is usually presented at different sessions of main robotics conferences, making the exchange of ideas and
collaborations difficult.
