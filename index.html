							<h2>Workshop proposal ICRA2021: Representing and Manipulating Deformable Objects</h2>
							
							<p>
							Deformable objects manipulation is a key component of a variety of everyday and specialized
applications, ranging from domestic housework such as cloth folding or food handing, to medical
scenarios such as surgery and suturing, up to industrial setups such as cable insertion. However, the large
configuration space of deformable objects causes traditional modelling, planning and control
approaches to fail when dealing with them. More specifically, unlike in the case of rigid objects, two
main challenges arise: i) there is no clear and unified state representation and ii) the dynamics is complex
and highly non-linear. This leads to the absence of current unified solutions and to highly domain-specific
approaches emerging in the fields of perception, simulation, control and mechanics. In addition, the lack
of scalable simulation environments limits possible developments in the above fields. We believe that
robust progress can only be achieved by combining these complementary areas of robotics. Therefore,
this workshop aims to start a discussion about the current state-of-the-art and possible research
directions as well as connect people from different sub-fields to solve deformable objects challenges.

							<h2>Content</h2>
							<h3>Event description </h3>

							<p> 
								The workshop is tailored towards researchers interested at deformable object manipulation and closely
related problems such as modeling, perception, representation and mechanics. This workshop would
give the community a chance to: identify open research challenges, find new applications for techniques
that already exist in closely related areas, foster new collaborations, and get a good overview of the state
-of-the-art from the invited talks. Speakers from the forefront of the research on deformable objects are
invited to provide top-level insights. Furthermore, a review process from experienced researchers will
be carried out giving young researchers the opportunity to receive valuable feedbacks.
The scope of the workshop is intentionally broad as we think that different aspects need to be taken into
account to effectively handle deformable objects and we want to enclose them in a single event, filling
the lack of a dedicated session in the main robotics conferences.  
							</p>

							
							
							<p> </p>	

							<h3>Topic relevance </h3>
							<p> Despite the presence of deformable objects in a wide range of domains and tasks, endowing robots with
the ability to manipulate them is still an open problem. This is motivated by the extreme complexity of
representation and dynamics modeling of such objects. Although different methodologies exist in the
recent state-of-the-art, tackling different aspects of deformable objects, no unified and comprehensive
solution exists yet that can be easily generalized to non-specific objects. 
As possible approaches to state representation and modelling, topological coordinates and Finite
Element Methods have been adopted for solving specific tasks. In contrast, data-driven approaches can
be leveraged to circumvent explicit modelling at the cost of an expensive data collection. For this,
although simulation environments would be most suited for collecting large amount of data, the current
state-of-the-art does not enable it in an efficient and scalable manner. Moreover, even when a
simulation setup is employed, the transfer of the acquired skills into real-world may be unsuccessful due
to inaccurate simulation models of the involved dynamics. Alternatively, demonstrating specific
interactions, and learning from them by imitation, can improve the efficiency of the system setup at the
cost of its generality.
In addition, further aspects need to be addressed to effectively manipulate deformable objects. Among
those, employment and coordination of two or more arms can be necessary to properly manipulate
highly deformable objects for both prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation. Finding efficient ways
to combine planning and control is equally important in this regard. Finally, implementing the planned
interaction can also be improved by specialized grippers or sensors, e.g., optical and haptic perception.</p>

<p>

Specifically, this workshop will focus on the following topics: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Representation and state estimation</li>
  <li> Simulation and modeling </li>
  <li>Transfer from simulation to reality</li>
  <li>Data-driven methods: end-to-end learning, learning from demonstration, etc. </li>
  <li>Perception: state tracking, parameter identification, property detection (e.g. landmarks for
garments) and classification, etc. </li>
  <li>Control, visual servoing and planning</li>
  <li>Multi-arm manipulation</li>
  <li>Specialized tools, e.g. grippers, and sensors</li>
  <li>Application-specific challenges: cloth folding, surgical tasks, etc.</li>
</ul>
